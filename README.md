# ArcExampleFiles
The purpose of this repository is to assist lab members in navigating ARC.
This repository contains an example slurm file, data, and matlab script to refer to or practice with.

For practice, feel free to download the script, slurm file, and mat file to your computer.
  Go through the script and slurm file, and fill in your personal information where necessary.
  Upload the script, slurm file, and data mat file to your globus.
  Go to ARC, and practice submitting the slurm file! -->   sbacth ArcExampleSlurm.slurm
  If done correctly, you will receive an email when it is done running, and you can go to your globus 
       results folder where you should find a mat file named 'ArcExample.mat'. This file will contain
       two variables, even_num and even_num_mean. 
       
Have fun super computing! :)
